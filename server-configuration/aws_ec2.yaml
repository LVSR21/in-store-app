  ansible_host: private_ip_address  # This maps the private IP address to ansible_host variable. This tells Ansible which IP to use when connecting.



  # ------------------------- EXPLANATION ------------------------- #
  # The AWS EC2 plugin is a dynamic inventory plugin that queries AWS API to get information about EC2 instances. 
  # This plugin is useful whenever instances re created and destroyed frequently. 
  # It allows me to manage my infrastructure without having to manually update my inventory file (aws_ec2.yaml) every time an instances ares created or destroyed.
